-- Adding another branch into the branch table

INSERT INTO branch VALUES(4, 'Buffalo', NULL, NULL);

-- Join is used to combine rows from different table into one table based on the related column.
-- Find all branches and names of their managers

SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;

-- Left Join, when we use left join we include all of the rows from the left table

SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;

-- Right join, same applies here

SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;
