-- On DELETE SET NULL
-- Deleting foreign key relationships between tables
-- on delete set null sets the value to NULL if if we delete an employee id
-- and the employee associated to other branches with foreign keys. 

CREATE TABLE branch(
    branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(40),
    mgr_id INT,
    mgr_start_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

DELETE FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id = 102;

SELECT *

-- ON DELETE CASCADE
-- on delete cascade is almost the same thing but instead of setting NULL
-- this will delete the entire row in the database.

CREATE TABLE branch_supplier(
    branch_id INT,
    supplier_name VARCHAR(40),
    supply_type VARCHAR(40),

-- NOTE: i) Only foreign keys should have NULL value wherease primary key
-- can't be set to NULL value. You just have to delete the entire thing.
