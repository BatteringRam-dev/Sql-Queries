-- Union function
-- We can use union function to combine the results of multiple select statements into one
-- When using Union we need to have same number of columns in the select statement
-- When using Union we need to have similar datatypes. For example in the below code,
-- "first_name" and "branch_name" both are strings and going to return strings.

SELECT first_name
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT branch_name
FROM branch;

-- Find a list of all client and branch supplier's name

SELECT client_name, client.branch_id
FROM client
UNION
SELECT supplier_name, branch_supplier.branch_id
FROM branch_supplier;

-- Find a list of all money spent or earned by the company

SELECT salary 
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT total_sales 
FROM works_with;
