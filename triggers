-- Trigger, trigger is a block of sql code which will define a certain
-- action should happen when a certain operation gets performed on a database.
-- I could write a trigger which will tell mysql to do something when like an
-- entry was added into a particular table in the database or when something gets deleted

CREATE TABLE trigger_test(
    message VARCHAR(100)
);

DELIMITER $$
CREATE
    TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT 
    ON employee
    FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
        INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added new employee');
    END$$
DELIMITER ;  

-- Usually mysql delimiters are ";" we use this to end off a sql command but 
-- in trigger we can't use it to end off the trigger creation. So we create
-- a new delimiter and after the trigger we can change it back to semicolon.
-- Delimiter is not defined on the popsql so we can use the mysql command client.
-- After triggering the trigger in mysql command client we can add another employee now and check.

INSERT INTO employee
VALUES(109, 'Oscar', 'Martinez', '1968-02-19', 'M', 69000, 106, 3);

SELECT * FROM trigger_test

-- Complexed Trigger

         ELSEIF NEW.sex = 'F' THEN
               INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added female employee');
         ELSE

-- We can also drop triggers by typing " DROP TRIGGER 'trigger name';" 
-- in the mysql command client
